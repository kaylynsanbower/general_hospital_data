# general_hospital_data


Each of the folders in this repository have subfolders that follow the same structure, which is defined as follows. 

* **data** -- this folder will contain two subfolders, "input" and "output." The former contains the raw data files, and the latter contains the data files that are produced using the code in the "data-code" file. Note that I have not uploaded any of input data to the the publicly available raw data files to github, but the URLs to the data sources are given below. 
* **data-code** -- this folder
