# general_hospital_data
repo covering cleaning and prepping for (publicly available) hospital data used across multiple analyses


Each of the folders in this repository have subfolders that follow the same structure. 

* **data** -- insofar as it is publicly available, this folder will contain two subfolders, "input" and "output." The former contains the raw data files, and the latter contains the data files that are produced using the code in the "data-code" file. 
* **data-code** -- this folder



# CMI 
The CMI data come from [the NBER](https://www.nber.org/research/data/centers-medicare-medicaid-services-cms-casemix-file-hospital-ipps).
